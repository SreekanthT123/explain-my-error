# ExplainMyError

**Understand errors. Fix faster.**

ExplainMyError is a small developer tool that explains common error messages and stack traces in plain English.  
It helps developers quickly understand *what an error means*, *why it usually happens*, and *what to check first* — without digging through docs or forums.

## ✨ What ExplainMyError Does

- Accepts error messages or stack traces
- Explains the error in simple, human-readable terms
- Highlights the most likely cause
- Suggests the first thing to check
- Clearly communicates uncertainty when context is limited

This is a **best-effort explanation tool**, not a debugger or code fixer.

## 👨‍💻 Who Is This For?

- Frontend developers (Angular, JavaScript, etc.)
- Backend developers (Node.js and general errors)
- Anyone who wants quick clarity on confusing error messages

---

## ❌ What This Tool Does NOT Do

- It does **not** fix your code
- It does **not** guarantee correctness
- It does **not** replace debugging or testing
- It does **not** generate code

Explanations are based on common patterns and limited context.
